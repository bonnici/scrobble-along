# Deprecation note

I've decided to stop updating ScrobbleAlong since I've moved on to other projects and adding new stations is becoming a bit unmaintainable. I am planning to keep it running but will not add any more stations or fix any stations that break.

# Original readme

This just contains history and submodules for two repos that used to be contained here, [scrobble-along-scrobbler](https://github.com/bonnici/scrobble-along-scrobbler) and [scrobble-along-website](https://github.com/bonnici/scrobble-along-website).
